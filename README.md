# Premier

This is a test project for ETPâ€™s partner Premier. They provided screenshots of two pages of a website. The task was to program these out in HTML, not using a template. The goal being to create something that is easy to update without having to create an image to drop in (text boxes over images vs text that is part of the image.). Images and company branding was not provided.

Home and About page created only using HTML5 and CSS3, no CMS was used.
